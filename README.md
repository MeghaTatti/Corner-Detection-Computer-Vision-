# Corner-Detection-Computer-Vision-
This project opens camera and takes two pictures and detects Corner using Open CV.

## Problem Statement:
1. Corner Detection with matching two similar images.
2. Load and display 2 images or capture by webcam.
3. Estimate image gradients and apply the Harris corner detection algorithm.
4. Obtain a better localization of each corner.
5. Compute a feature vector for each corner point.
6. Display the corners by drawing empty rectangles over the original image centered at
locations where corners were detected.
